# Performance Testing Module
Take PerformanceTesting.zip, unblock it, and place it in C:\Program Files\Decisions\Decisions Services Manager\CustomModules

Navigate within Decisions to System>Administration>Features, find the Performance Testing module. Install, then restart Decisions. Once it restarts, you should have a folder at root within Decisions, and within that folder there is the Performance testing Dashboard.
